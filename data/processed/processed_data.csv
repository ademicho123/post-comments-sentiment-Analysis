It may have been a trigger because a former partner asked me the same question in a  different way.
 They asked why are you helping those kids in Madagascar and putting your energy there. 
My thought was kids are kids.  Also, you mentioned Vladamir and Saddam. Both of them have passed  that through my mind knowing the horrific things facilitated under their power.    I recall two news reports;  Saddam was incarcerated and was seen planting a small flower and observing it with wonder. Vlladamir was seen on another program out in the wilderness on a kayak ( or canoe) and looked really at peace. I'll never forget those two flickers of hope.  They were reminders  that compassion can heal the whole world if we can all see the love in each other and only focus there... Just like the Grinch...LOVE changes people if we really focus with all of our hearts and minds as Dr. Richard is doing..  Thank you so much Mr. Weiner for posting this  is Truly heart felt.

1. Adding adjustments only changes the associated list. If true, then campaigns would not see more conversions (or lower CPAs if above target). We often see more efficient campaigns with audience adjustments.

2. It adjusts the impression share by audience. If true, then we are giving the system better signals for targeting - and when systems get more data - they do a better job.

3. Audience adjustments aren't used (I still hear this). If this were true, then we wouldn't ever see data changes with adjustments - I think we can rule this out.

We also know that smart bidding makes a lot of dumb decisions. For instance, they don't use n-grams to be better at bidding (https://adalysis.com/blog/how-to-steer-the-machine-with-negative-keywords/). And that's why we give the machine signals with negative keywords. 

They don't learn about 'matching queries' very well. I.e. ""average cost of XYZ"" is the EXACT same as ""XYZ Quote"" in Google's eye even though the first is 3x average CPA of the second.

The truth with audiences probably lies between 1 & 2. We're hand feeding the system better signals to use (of which is probably missed some itself) and, therefore, making it more efficient.

A few reasons for why:

It lacks personal experience. 
??Thought leadership relies on personal insights, stories, anecdotes and in-depth industry knowledge. This is often very nuanced and hard to fake.

Inability to Stay Relevant 
??The best thought leadership is often reactions or commentary on current events. Most AI models have a delay and are not able to tap in the most current trends and news developments. 

Risk of Bias and Not Including Diverse perspectives 
??We all know AI models are faulty in this area. Even if it’s trained on your own voice it may not overcome these. 

Human Emotion & Empathy

This is why I firmly believe that any manager training that doesn’t also root into “personal transformation” & self-reflection / trauma-informed practices (my dream!) misses the mark. So many times these behaviors aren’t always / exclusively a conscious choice - unless we’re talking true narcissism -then MAYBE. They’re (mal)adaptive strategies to achieve a desired result (self-esteem, power, control, etc.) This in NO way makes it better, acceptable, or removes accountability, quite the contrary. It just means that we can’t separate ourselves or our behaviors from work in the way we want or in the way capitalism demands of us. We show up at work and in work relationships often times as we would in “real life” relationships. I’d honestly argue that work conditions can create more problematic behaviors, if the conditions are right. Just as work can “trigger” us more than other things might. The managers who positively impacted my mental health were folks who had “done the work.” They had high self-awareness, genuine capacity for empathy, along with practical teachable skills needed to manage.",3,0,True,False,"2/5/2024, 7:01:47 PM",1135,0.8849,positive,0,rachael turquand sure firmly believe manager training also root personal transformation self reflection trauma informed practice dream miss mark many time behavior always exclusively conscious choice unless talking true narcissism maybe mal adaptive strategy achieve desired result self esteem power control etc way make better acceptable remove accountability quite contrary mean separate behavior work way want way capitalism demand u show work work relationship often time would real life relationship honestly argue work condition create problematic behavior condition right work trigger u thing might manager positively impacted mental health folk done work high self awareness genuine capacity empathy along practical teachable skill needed manage

That doesn't mean what the meme represents; depending on who is posting and who is reading it, it describes the full range of facts surrounding the incident. Social media marketers are more interested in attention than in helping leaders work through authentic leadership issues. You will get the point if you manage an organization with a few hundred people; you don't know if it is you and the camera crew.  

I get the point about mindset. The problem I have is whether some of the people posting these memes understand about mindset. Can they see it from another point of view besides their own?

Key aspects of the book include:

- **Lincoln's Political Strategy**: Goodwin delves into how Lincoln was able to bring his competitors together, creating a cabinet that was unmatched in its abilities. Despite their differences, Lincoln managed to direct their talents toward a common goal, demonstrating his exceptional skills in persuasion and empathy.

- **In-depth Character Studies**: The book offers detailed portraits of the key figures in Lincoln's cabinet, including William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edwin M. Stanton, and Edward Bates. These profiles provide insights into their personal ambitions, political beliefs.

""Team of Rivals"" has been praised for its detailed research, engaging writing style, and its portrayal of Lincoln as a leader capable of reconciling conflicting personalities and viewpoints for the greater good. The book was awarded the Lincoln Prize and the inaugural Book Prize for American History from the New-York Historical Society. It also served as a partial basis for the 2012 film ""Lincoln,"" directed by Steven Spielberg.

At the end of the day, the impact of AI will depend on how we choose to use it. We can either use it to replace human workers and reduce costs, or we can use it to enhance human potential and create new opportunities. It's up to us to decide how we want to shape the future of AI.

We are living in a country and in a world that in many ways has failed to provide us with a decent life.

We care so much more about corporate profits than other humans and their well being and it's so incredibly backwards.

Then there is the concept of expectations.  We are shooting ourselves in the foot by making goals for things like follower count or bigger business results in the short term.

These should be set on a yearly basis or more.

It guarantees financial debt.

I know people who went to Ivy League schools and people who didn’t. And I have rich friends on both sides.

Neither guarantees success.

Nor does being able to do math equations in your head or having the perfect golf swing.

Most of the people who I know that are financially successful did well because:

1. They are resilient and don’t ever quit.
2. They are risk takers and will put everything on the line to accomplish their dreams.
3. They learn from their mistakes. They may not be the smartest but they know if they don’t make the same mistakes over and over again they are more likely to succeed.

The main goal of an automated kitchen is making food by the machine will free a or more person from spending considerable time in the kitchen (especially if they are terrible cooks!), allows planning and cooking of healthy nutritious food and so much more...?? . If done right, it will completely change how we look at the kitchen and related activities with it! But it will take incredible effort to get there! 

Maybe some of the best byproducts at the higher level will be large amounts of data regarding food, allowing us to study its impact on food production and distribution as well as ""climate change"" effects (if there are any)!  

I believe the best option is to tackle (reimagining) the entire home instead of just an automated kitchen. For sure, it will require Goliath level effort!
